1. Creating a Shared Directory

Command used:
sudo mkdir /var/soc_shared 

What this does:

Creates a directory in /var

/var is a system-level directory, so sudo is required

Why /var?

/var commonly stores:

Logs

Shared runtime data

SOC analysts often interact with /var/log

This simulates a shared SOC data location.

2. Assigning Ownership
Command:
sudo chown zakariya:socmonitor /var/soc_shared

Breakdown:

zakariya → owner

socmonitor → group

What this means:

The owner (zakariya) controls the directory

Members of socmonitor group get group-level access

This models controlled shared access.

3. Setting Permissions (chmod)
Command:
sudo chmod 750 /var/soc_shared

Permission Breakdown:
Value	Meaning
7	Owner → read, write, execute
5	Group → read, execute
0	Others → no access
Result:

Owner can fully manage the directory

Group can enter and read, but not create files

Others are completely blocked

This enforces least privilege.

4. Switching to SOC Analyst User
Command:
sudo -i -u socmonitor

What this does:

Switches to the socmonitor user

Loads their full environment

This simulates logging in as a SOC analyst, not an admin.

5. Testing Access as socmonitor
Commands:
cd /var/soc_shared
pwd
whoami

Purpose:

Confirm current user

Confirm directory access

✅ Access allowed → directory readable
❌ Write blocked → permission denied

6. Attempting File Creation (Expected Failure)
Command:
touch test.txt

Result:
Permission denied

Why this happened:

Group permission = 5 (read + execute)

No write permission

This proves permissions are working as intended.

7. Verifying from Admin User
Command:
exit
ls /var/soc_shared

Result:

Directory exists

No files created by socmonitor

This confirms:

Permissions are enforced system-wide

Users cannot bypass controls

Security Concepts Demonstrated
🔐 Least Privilege

Users only get what they need — nothing more.

🧾 Access Control

Linux permissions enforce security boundaries.

🧑‍💻 SOC Relevance

Log directories

Incident artifacts

Malware samples
All require controlled access.

Why This Matters for SOC Analysts

In a real SOC:

Analysts often read logs

They do not modify system files

Improper permissions = security incident

This lab demonstrates:

Why permissions matter

How misconfigurations can expose systems

How to verify access safely

Key Commands Summary (for your notes)
mkdir        # create directories
chown        # change ownership
chmod        # change permissions
whoami       # verify user
pwd          # verify location
touch        # test write access
ls -l        # view permissions

Final Reflection (important for you to write in your own words)

This exercise helped me understand how Linux enforces permissions at the filesystem level and why SOC analysts must respect access boundaries. I learned how to test permissions safely and verify whether controls are working as expected.
