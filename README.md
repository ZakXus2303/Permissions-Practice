# Linux Permissions & Access Control Lab (SOC-Focused)

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental Linux permission management and access control concepts relevant to a SOC Analyst role. The lab focuses on enforcing least privilege, validating access boundaries, and verifying permissions using standard Linux tools.

The objective was not to memorise commands, but to understand **why** permissions exist and **how** misconfigurations can impact system security.
